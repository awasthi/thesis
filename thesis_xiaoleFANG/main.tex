{\large\textbf{Abstract:}}
As any well-designed information security application uses a very large quantity of good pseudorandom numbers, inefficient generation of these numbers can be a significant bottleneck in various situations. Consequently, pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) are very important primitives widely used in numerous applications like numerical simulations or security. For instance, they are one of the most fundamental component that any cryptosystem has to embed, in order to generate encryption keys or keystreams in symmetric ciphers.\\
Nowadays, due to the distinct properties of chaos, including random-like dynamics and high sensitivity on initial conditions, the use of chaos in random number generation and cryptographical applications has aroused tremendous interests. In previous researches, a technique that applies some well-defined discrete iterations, satisfying the reputed Devaney's definition of chaos, has been developed. It has been proven that the generators embedding these chaotic iterations (CIs) produce truly chaotic random numbers.\\
In this thesis, the schemes that generate pseudorandom number based on discrete chaotic iterations are rethought and optimized.
This manuscript contains mainly two parts. 
In the first part, the original methods are firstly researched deeper and proven to be crytographically secure, and secondly two faster generators with better statistical performance are introduced. Then the statistical analysis of the chaotic iterations methods for random number generators are summarized, while their strength and weakness are also commented, which lead us to improve the generation rate of such generators.  These generators based on chaotic iterations are then redesigned specifically for Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) hardware. Finally, practical applications that implement CI technology in software and hardware are expressed, and their evaluations are also done.

In the second part, a scheme using optoelectronic chaotic signal to generate random streams is studied. In 2009, Reidler \emph{et al.} published a paper entitled ``An optical ultrafast random bit generator'', in which they presented a physical system for random number generation based on a chaotic semiconductor laser. This generator is claimed to reach potentially the extremely high rate of 300 Gb/s. This method is analyzed in the thesis, and the discussion about actual origin of the randomness and the actually reachable bit rate have been given. We show that the actual binary sequence randomness is corresponding more to complex mixing of noisy components performed by digital post-processing operations, than to chaotic properties of the signal. We also address the issue of a proper way to use chaotic motion in RNGs, which is shown to necessarily involve MSB instead of the LSB. Then, at the end of the manuscript, two examples of adapting chaotic iterations with simulated chaotic waveform to generate random sequences are shown, 
and finally NIST test suite is used 
to evaluate the randomnesses.
