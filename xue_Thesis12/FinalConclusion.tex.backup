\section{Conclusions}
Chaos, being a special class of nonlinear dynamics, has aroused a lot of interests since its
discovery. It is well-known with its distinct characteristics, such as the exhibition of
random-like behaviors, the sensitive dependence on initial conditions and control parameters,
the ergodic and mixing nature, and so on.
Recently, many research works have been witnessed where the chaotic dynamics are
applied for cryptographical applications and designs. Being a major element in cryptography,
the nature of randomness and chaos have been related, and the blossom of chaos-based
random number generators and cryptographical systems is observed, even though it causes
considerable controversy to comment that chaos is a very good candidate.
In most of the designs, the generation of chaos is obtained by a recurrence relationship
or a set of state differential equations, in which perfect model is assumed. It always requires a
continuous space domain so that the actual chaotic dynamics can be observed. However, this
compact space domain implies the use of real-number or infinite bit representation in system
realization.
As pinpointed by some researchers, the digital dynamical properties of a chaotic system
will be far different from its continuous ones. For example,
when some piecewise linear
maps are realized in finite computing precision, some severe problems such as short cycle
length, non-ideal distribution and high correlation, have been observed and reported.
Recognizing that it is more realistic and practical to consider a chaotic system realized in
finite precision domain, in this thesis, the quantization effects on commonly used chaotic
maps such as Chebyshev map, skew tent map, logistic map and sawtooth map have been
investigated. As reported in Chapter 4, different levels of statistical performance deterioration
are discovered for different chaotic maps. While these maps are used to generate the random
sequences, patterns, high correlation, orbits with short periodic cycles and biasing distribution
are found and illustrated. In general, it can be concluded that the tent bit sequence has the best
statistical performance. However, if a cryptographical application is targeted, the direct usage
of chaos-based random number generator becomes definitely inappropriate. This has been
clearly reflected by their extreme low passing rates in the NIST statistical test suite as shown
in the chapter.
From the study of random number generators, it is learnt that it is possible to improve
the statistic qualities of a sequence by means of post-processing method. However, to fit for
the limitations of bit precision and realization requirement, a new post-processing function
based on a high-dimensional Cat map is designed in Chapter 5. Using a data feedback
approach, the statistical qualities of a sequence generated by discretized tent map are greatly
improved after post-processing. From the experimental results, it shows that the newly
proposed post-processing method outperforms those existing post-processing functions
including Von Neumann corrector, SHA-1, high dimensional cat map, XOR based
post-processing and shift-register based post-processing.
This chaos-based post-processing function provides a major element for the design of
the 32-bit chaos-based random number generator, which has been explained in details in
Chapter 6. By generating the bit sequence with a discretized tent map, and after
post-processing, a very nice random number sequence is obtained. Its randomness is verified
with different statistical criteria and also the stringent NIST test suite which commonly used
to verify the random number sequences used in cryptographical applications.
In Chapter 6, another challenge of designing a random number generator for very
low-precision system is also resolved. In industrial and consumer markets, low cost
micro-controllers and micro-processors are still widely used. However, the low precision and
the limitations of resources in these systems have hindered the implementation of random
function, causing some trade-offs or limitations in applications. An example is the “random
shuffle” function in the music devices. Although songs are supposed to be selected randomly,
in fact, the sequence is not random. The quality of the random function will also affect the
performance of some algorithms to be implemented in such a low precision environment.
Typical examples include evolutionary algorithms and encryption algorithms.
Therefore, a random number generator based on a simple chaotic circuit and the
chaos-based post-processing function is suggested. By sampling a state of the chaotic double
scroll attractor generated by a modified Chua’s circuit with common and low cost electronic
components, a non-periodic signal is obtained. However, this signal is found to be biased and
highly correlated. It is hence post-processed by the high-dimensional Cat map with feedback
as before, but the map is now in 8-bit precisions only. The experimental results show that a
very nice random number generator can be realized and the generated bit sequences fulfill all
the statistical requirements, including the tests in NIST.
Finally, a practical secured chatting system via UDP is designed in a 32-bit machine.
Utilizing our simple and fast 32-bit chaos-based random number generator for keystream
generation, the voice signal can be encrypted online based on a stream cipher structure. The
experimental results show that it can resist the eavesdropping, and the signals appear to be
garbage if the user password is unknown.



\section{Future Work}
From my research work, it is understood that quantization plays an important roles in
chaos dynamics, and greatly affect the usage of chaotic maps or systems in random number
generation. In fact, quantization functions have been formulated in control theory and signal
processing via some transformations, and interesting nature, such as limit cycle, has been
reported. Therefore, instead of using a direct digitization as suggested in this thesis, it will be
interesting to see whether it is possible to construct a complete dynamical system, including
both the map and the quantization function under certain transformation. This may let us have
a better understanding of the dynamics of the discretized version of the chaotic map, which in
turn, help to formulate a general rule for discretization so that its overall behaviours are more
similar to its continuous counterpart.
Moreover, from the extensive simulation results, it is noticed that the proposed
high-dimensional Cat map possesses a strong mixing property, and the success of the
proposed chaos-based random number generators is actually largely dependent on this nature.
It will be a challenging but important step if some theoretical work can be carried out so that
the mixing property of high-dimensional Cat map can be proved mathematically in the future.
In the design of secure chattering system, it is found that the throughput of the proposed
32-bit chaos-based random number generator is just sufficient for the duplex online
encryption/decryption of voice signals. It is always some demands to extend the design so that
image or video signals can be included, such as in a video conferencing system. That of
course implies a faster approach and some further work have to be done.
