In this chapter, some basic concepts and works are reviewed. Firstly four classic PRNGs are introduced, these generators in latter parts are adapted to CI methods to generate random streams. Then a previous work is recalled: the previous versions of CI PRNGs \cite{bibtexwangqianxue} are described.

\section{Presentation of new well known generators}
\label{The generation of pseudo-random sequence}

\subsection{Introduction}

Normally PRNGs can be classified in four major classes: linear generators, lagged generators, inversive generators, and mix generators, see Fig.~\ref{Ontological class hierarchy of RNGs}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Linear generators}, defined by a linear recurrence, are the most commonly analyzed and utilized generators. The main linear generators are LCGs and MLCG.
 \item \textbf{Lagged generators} have a general recursive formula that use various previously computed terms in the determination of the new sequence value.
 \item \textbf{Inversive congruential generators} form a recent class of generators that are based on the principle of congruential inversion.
 \item \textbf{Mixed generators} result from the need for sequences of better and better quality, or at least longer periods. This usually leads to mix different types of PRNGs, as follows: $x^i=y^i\oplus z^i$
\end{itemize}

Let us firstly explain with more details the generators studied in this research work (for a synthetic view, see Fig.~\ref{Ontological class hierarchy of RNGs}).

\subsection{Blum Blum Shub}
The Blum Blum Shub generator~\cite{BBS} (usually denoted by BBS) takes the form:\\
$$x^0 \in \llbracket 1, m-1 \rrbracket$$
$$x^{n+1}=(x^n \times x^n) ~ mod~ m, ~~ y^{n+1} = x^{n+1}~ mod~ log(log(m)),$$  
where $m$ is the product of two prime numbers (these prime numbers  need to be congruent to $3$ modulus $4$), $x^n$ is an integer value, and it should be an integer that's co-prime to M. $y^n$ is the returned 
binary sequence. To be noticed, for its part, $log$ refers to the logarithm to base $2$.

\subsection{The logistic map}

The logistic map, given by:
\begin{center}
$x^{n+1}=\mu ~ x^{n}(1-x^{n})$, with $x^{0}\in(0,1)$, $\mu \in(3.99996,4]$,
\end{center}

\noindent where $x$ is a real number. Logistic map was originally introduced as a demographic model by Pierre Fran\c cois Verhulst in 1838. In 1947, Ulam and Von Neumann ~\cite{ulam1947} studied it as a PRNG. This essentially requires mapping the states of the system $\left(x^n\right)_{n \in \mathds{N}}$ to $\{0,1\}^\mathds{N}$. A simple way for turning $x^n$ to a discrete bit symbol $r$ is by using a threshold function as it is shown in Algo.\ref{logisticmap1}.
A second usual way to obtain an integer sequence from a real system is to chop off the leading bits after moving the decimal point of each $x$ to the right, as it is obtained in Algo.\ref{logisticmap2}.

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} the internal state $x$ (a decimal number)\\
\textbf{Output:} $r$ (a 1-bit word)
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE$x\leftarrow{4x(1-x)}$
\IF{$x\textless0$}
{
\STATE$r\leftarrow0$;	
}
\ELSE
{
\STATE$r\leftarrow1$;	
}\ENDIF
\STATE return $r$\;
\medskip

\end{algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} the internal state $x$ (a decimal number)\\
\textbf{Output:} $r$ (an integer)
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE$x\leftarrow{4x(1-x)}$
\STATE$r\leftarrow{\lfloor10000000x\rfloor}$
\STATE return $r$\;
\medskip
\caption{An arbitrary round of logistic map 2}
\label{logisticmap2}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{LCG}
This PRNG implements either the simple or the combined linear congruency generator (LCGs). The simple LCG is defined by the recurrence:
\begin{equation}
x^n = (ax^{n-1} + c)~mod~m
\label{LCG}
\end{equation}
where $a$, $c$, and $x^0$ must be non-negative and less than $m$~\cite{Lecuyer2009} integers. In what follows, 2LCGs and 3LCGs refer as two (resp. three) combinations of such LCGs.
For further details, see~\cite{combined_lcg}.

\subsection{MRG}
This module implements multiple recursive generators (MRGs), based on a linear recurrence of order integer $k$, modulo $m$~\cite{Lecuyer2009}:
\begin{equation}
x^n = (a^1x^{n-1}+~...~+a^kx^{n-k})~mod~m
\label{MRG}
\end{equation}
Combination of two MRGs (referred as 2MRGs) is also used in this chapter.

\subsection{UCARRY}
Generators based on linear recurrences with carry are implemented in this module. This includes the add-with-carry (AWC) generator, based on the recurrence:
\begin{equation}
\label{AWC}
\begin{array}{l}
x^n = (x^{n-r} + x^{n-s} + c^{n-1})~mod~m, \\
c^n= (x^{n-r} + x^{n-s} + c^{n-1}) / m, \end{array}\end{equation}
with output: $x^i/m$. The $k$ initial values $(x^0,... ,x^{k-1})$ is firstly set with random integers.
the $k = max\{r, s\}$ (the bigger one assigned to $k$), and $c$ contains $c^0$. Restrictions: $0 < s, 0 < r, r\neq s$ and $c = 0 or 1$.

The SWB generator, having the recurrence:
\begin{equation}
\label{SWB}
\begin{array}{l}
x^n = (x^{n-r} - x^{n-s} - c^{n-1})~mod~m, \\
c^n=\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
1 ~~~~~\text{if}~ (x^{i-r} - x^{i-s} - c^{i-1})<0\\
0 ~~~~~\text{else},\end{array} \right. \end{array}\end{equation}
with output is $x^i/m$. The vector $S[0..(k-1)]$ contains
the $k$ initial values $(x^0,... x^{k-1})$, where $k = max\{r, s\}$, and $c$ contains $c0$. Restrictions : $0 < s,0 < r, r 6= s$ and $c = 0$ or $1$.
And the SWC generator designed by R. Couture, which is based on the following recurrence:
\begin{equation}
\label{SWC}
\begin{array}{l}
x^n = (a^1x^{n-1} \oplus ~...~ \oplus a^rx^{n-r} \oplus c^{n-1}) ~ mod ~ 2^w, \\
c^n = (a^1x^{n-1} \oplus ~...~ \oplus a^rx^{n-r} \oplus c^{n-1}) ~ / ~ 2^w. \end{array}\end{equation}
with output is $x^i/2^w$. The vector $(x^n,...x^{n-r+1}, c^n)$ is the state of the generator. The array $A[0..h-1]$ contains the polynomials $a^1,...,a^r$. Each even element stands for a polynomial number and the next
element stands for the corresponding nonzero coefficient number of that polynomial. The vector
$S[0..r-1]$ gives the initial values of $(x^0,...,x^{r-1})$ and $c$ is the initial carry. Restrictions: $0 < r,$
and $w \leq 32$.

\subsection{GFSR}
This module implements the generalized feedback shift register (GFSR) generator, that is:
\begin{equation}
x^n = x^{n-r} \oplus x^{n-k}
\label{GFSR}
\end{equation}
Where the $x$ sequence are initial with some random positive integers, $n>k$ and $n>r$.

\subsection{INV}
Finally, this module implements the nonlinear inversive generator, as defined in~\cite{Lecuyer2009}, which is:

\begin{equation}
\label{INV}
\begin{array}{l}
x^n=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
(a^1 + a^2 / z^{n-1})~mod~m & \text{if}~ z^{n-1} \neq 0 \\
a^1 & \text{if}~  z^{n-1} = 0 .\end{array} \right. \end{array}\end{equation}

The generator computes $z$ via the modified Euclid algorithm (see \cite{Lecuyer2009}). If $m$ is prime and if $p(x) = x^2 -a^1 x -a^2$ is a primitive polynomial modulo $m$, then the generator has maximal period $m$. Restrictions: $0 \leq z^0 < m, 0 < a^1 < m$ and $0 < a^2 < m$. Furthermore, $m$ must be a prime number, preferably large.


\subsection{XORshift}
\label{XORshift}

XORshift is a category of very fast PRNGs designed by George Marsaglia~\cite{Marsaglia2003}. It repeatedly uses the transform of \emph{exclusive or} (XOR) on a number with a bit shifted version of it. The state of a XORshift generator is a vector of bits. At each step, the next state is obtained by applying a given number of XORshift operations to $w$-bit blocks in the current state, where $w = 32$ or $64$. A XORshift operation is defined as follows. Replace the $w$-bit block by a bitwise XOR of the original block, with a shifted copy of itself by $a$ positions either to the right or to the left, where $ 0 < a < w$. This Algo.\ref{XORshift} is an example for $32$-bit XORshift, it has a period of $2^{32}-1=4.29\times10^9$.


\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} the internal state $z$ (a 32-bits word)\\
\textbf{Output:} $y$ (a 32-bits word)
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\STATE$z\leftarrow{z\oplus{(z\ll13)}}$;
\STATE$z\leftarrow{z\oplus{(z\gg17)}}$;
\STATE$z\leftarrow{z\oplus{(z\ll5)}}$;
\STATE$y\leftarrow{z}$;
\STATE return $y$\;
\medskip
\caption{An arbitrary round of XORshift algorithm}
\label{XORshift}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{ISAAC}
ISAAC is an array-based PRNG and a stream cipher designed by Robert Jenkins (1996) to be cryptographically secure~\cite{Jenkins1996}. The name is an acronym for Indirection, Shift, Accumulate, Add, and Count. The ISAAC algorithm has similarities with RC4~\cite{citeulike:3805944}. It uses an array of 256 32-bit integers as the internal state, writes the results to another 256-integer array, from which they are read one at a time until empty, at which point they are recomputed. Since it only takes about 19 32-bit operations for each 32-bit output word, it is extremely fast on 32-bit computers.

We give the key-stream procedure of ISAAC in Algo.\ref{ISAAC}. The internal state is $x$, the output array is $r$, and the inputs $32$-bit words $a$, $b$, and $c$ are those computed in the previous round. Normally $a$, $b$, $c$, and the array $r$ are initialized with some random sequences.% So we need the initial values of a,b, and c. Yes.
The value $f(a,i)$ in Algo.\ref{ISAAC} is a 32-bit word, defined for all $a$ and $i\in\{0,\dots,255\}$ as:

\begin{equation}
f(a,i) = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
a\ll13 & \text{if } i~mod~4\equiv0 , \\
a\gg6 & \text{if } i~mod~4\equiv1 , \\
a\ll2 & \text{if } i~mod~4\equiv2, \\
a\gg16 & \text{if } i~mod~4\equiv3. \\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} $a$, $b$, $c$, and the internal state $x$, they are $32$-bit words\\
\textbf{Output:} an array $r$ of 256 32-bit words
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE$c\leftarrow{c+1}$;
\STATE$b\leftarrow{b+c}$;
\WHILE{$i=0,\dots,255$}
\STATE$s\leftarrow{x_i}$;
\STATE$a\leftarrow{f(a,i)+x_{(i+128)~mod~256}}$;
\STATE$x_i\leftarrow{a+b+x_{(x\gg2)~mod~256}}$;
\STATE$r_i\leftarrow{s+x_{(x_i\gg10)~mod~256}}$;
\STATE$b\leftarrow{r_i}$;
\ENDWHILE
\STATE return $r$\;

\section{CIPRNG, version 1~\cite{wang2009}}
\label{Version 1 CI algorithms and examples}
\subsection{Chaotic iterations as PRNG}
\label{subsec Chaotic iterations as PRNG}
This first proposed version of a generator based on chaotic iterations, 
denoted by CI version 1 (PRNG1,PRNG2) (PRNG1 and PRNG2 are the generators produce positive integer), is designed by the following process~\cite{wang2009}. 

Let $\mathsf{N} \in \mathds{N}^*, \mathsf{N} \geqslant 2$. Some chaotic iterations are fulfilled to generate a sequence $\left(x^n\right)_{n\in\mathds{N}} \in \left(\mathds{B}^\mathsf{N}\right)^\mathds{N}$ of Boolean vectors: the successive states of the iterated system. Some of these vectors are randomly extracted and their components constitute our pseudorandom bit flow.
\begin{algorithm}
\textbf{Input:} the internal state $x$ (an array of $\mathsf{N}$ 1-bit words)\\
\textbf{Output:} an array $r$ of $\mathsf{N}$ 1-bit words
\begin{algorithmic}[1]

\STATE$a\leftarrow{PRNG1()}$;
\STATE$m\leftarrow{a~mod~2+k}$;
\WHILE{$i=0,\dots,m$}
\STATE$b\leftarrow{PRNG2()}$;
\STATE$S\leftarrow{b~mod~\mathsf{N}}$;
\STATE$x_S\leftarrow{ \overline{x_S}}$;
\ENDWHILE
\STATE$r\leftarrow{x}$;
\STATE return $r$;
\medskip
\caption{An arbitrary round of the CI generator Version 1}
\label{Chaotic iteration}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Chaotic iterations are realized as follows. Initial state $x^0 \in \mathds{B}^\mathsf{N}$ is a Boolean vector taken as a seed and strategy $\left(S^n\right)_{n\in\mathds{N}}\in \llbracket 1, \mathsf{N} \rrbracket^\mathds{N}$ is a sequence produced by PRNG2. Lastly, iterate function $f$ is the vectorial Boolean negation
$$f_0:(x_1,...,x_\mathsf{N}) \in \mathds{B}^\mathsf{N} \longmapsto (\overline{x_1},...,\overline{x_\mathsf{N}}) \in \mathds{B}^\mathsf{N}.$$
To sum up, at each iteration only $S^i$-th component of state $X^n$ is updated, as follows
\begin{equation}
x_i^n = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}x_i^{n-1} & \text{if } i \neq S^i, \\ \\ \overline{x_i^{n-1}} & \text{if } i = S^i. \\\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Finally, let $\mathcal{M}$ be a finite subset of $\mathds{N}^*$. Some $x^n$ are selected by a sequence $m^n$ as the pseudorandom bit sequence of our generator, $(m^n)_{n \in \mathds{N}} \in \mathcal{M}^\mathds{N}$ . So, the generator returns the following values: the components of $x^{m^0}$, followed by the components of $x^{m^0+m^1}$, followed by the components of $x^{m^0+m^1+m^2}$, \emph{etc.} In other words, the generator returns the following bits:

$$x_1^{m_0}x_2^{m_0}x_3^{m_0}\hdots x_\mathsf{N}^{m_0}x_1^{m_0+m_1}x_2^{m_0+m_1}\hdots x_\mathsf{N}^{m_0+m_1} x_1^{m_0+m_1+m_2}x_2^{m_0+m_1+m_2}\hdots$$
%and its $k^{th}$ bit is equal to $$\displaystyle{x_{k+1 \text{ (mod }\mathsf{N}\text{)}}^{\sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor k/\mathsf{N} \rfloor}m_i}}.$$

\noindent or the following integers:$$x^{m_0}x^{m_0+m_1}x^{m_0+m_1+m_2}\hdots$$


\subsection{CIPRNG version 1: the algorithm}
The basic design procedure of the CI generator version 1 is summed up in Algo.\ref{Chaotic iteration}. The internal state is $x$, the output array is $r$. $a$ and $b$ are those computed by PRNG1 and PRNG2. Lastly, $k$ and $\mathsf{N}$ are constants and \linebreak $\mathcal{M}=\{$k, k+1$\}$ ($k\geqslant 3\mathsf{N}$ is recommended, see \cite{bibtexwangqianxue} for more information).


\section{The CIPRNG: Version 2 ~\cite{wbg10:ip}}
%\subsection{Presentation}
%The CI generator (generator based on chaotic iterations) is designed by the following process. First of all, some chaotic iterations have to be done to generate a sequence 
%$\left(x^n\right)_{n\in\mathds{N}} \in \left(\mathds{B}^\mathsf{N}\right)^\mathds{N}$ 
%($\mathsf{N} \in \mathds{N}^*, \mathsf{N} \geqslant 2$, $N$ is not necessarily equal to 32) 
%of Boolean vectors, which are the successive states of the iterated system. Some of these vectors 
%will be randomly extracted and our pseudorandom bit flow will be constituted by their components. 
%Such chaotic iterations are realized as follows. 
%Initial state $x^0 \in \mathds{B}^\mathsf{N}$ is a Boolean vector taken as a 
%seed (see Section~\ref{algo seed}) and chaotic strategy $\left(S^n\right)_{n\in\mathds{N}}\in 
%\llbracket 1, \mathsf{N} \rrbracket^\mathds{N}$ is
%an irregular decimation of a random number sequence (Section~\ref{Chaotic strategy}). The iterate function $f$ is
%the vectorial Boolean negation:
%$$f_0:(x_1,...,x_\mathsf{N}) \in \mathds{B}^\mathsf{N} \longmapsto 
%(\overline{x_1},...,\overline{x_\mathsf{N}}) \in \mathds{B}^\mathsf{N}.$$
%At each iteration, only the $S^i$-th component of state $x^n$ is updated, 
%as follows: $x_i^n = x_i^{n-1}$ if $i \neq S^i$, else $x_i^n = \overline{x_i^{n-1}}$.
%Finally, some $x^n$ are selected
%by a sequence $m^n$ as the pseudorandom bit sequence of our generator.
%$(m^n)_{n \in \mathds{N}} \in \mathcal{M}^\mathds{N}$ is computed from 
%a PRNG, such as XORshift sequence $(y^n)_{n \in \mathds{N}} \in \llbracket 0, 
%2^{32}-1 \rrbracket$ (see Section~\ref{algo m}). So, the
%generator returns the following values:\newline
%\begin{small}
%Bits:$$x_1^{m_0}x_2^{m_0}x_3^{m_0}\hdots x_\mathsf{N}^{m_0}x_1^{m_0+m_1}x_2^{m_0+m_1}\hdots x_\mathsf{N}^{m_0+m_1} x_1^{m_0+m_1+m_2}\hdots$$
%or States:$$x^{m_0}x^{m_0+m_1}x^{m_0+m_1+m_2}\hdots$$
%\end{small}
%
%
%\subsection{The seed}
%\label{algo seed}
%The unpredictability of random sequences is established using
%a random seed that is obtained by a physical source like timings of keystrokes.
%Without the seed, the attacker must not be able to make any predictions about
%the output bits, even when all details of the generator are known~\cite{Turan2008}.
%
%The initial state of the system $x^0$ and the first term $y^0$ of the input PRNG are seeded either by
%the current time in seconds since the Epoch, or by a number that the user inputs.
%Different ways are possible. For example, let us denote by $t$ the decimal part of the current
%time. So $x^0$ can be $t \text{ (mod $2^N$)}$ written in binary digits and $y^0 = t$.
After the proof of concept of CIPRNG version 1, a second version of generator based on chaotic iterations has been introduced in \cite{wbg10:ip}.
\subsection{Defining the sequence $m^n$ }
\label{algo m}
The inputed PRNGs for CIPRNG version 2 (PRNG1, PRNG2) are the same as version 1. The basic idea was to prevent from changing a bit twice between two outputs, reducing by doing so the generation time. 
To do so, a sequence $(m^n)$ must be introduced, which defines the number 
of bits to change between two outputs.
The output of the sequence PRNG1 is uniform in $\llbracket 0, 2^{32}-1 \rrbracket$. However, we do not want the output of $(m^n)$ to be uniform in $\llbracket 0, N \rrbracket$, because in this case, the returns of our generator will not be uniform in $\llbracket 0, 2^{N}-1 \rrbracket$, as it is illustrated in the following example. Let us suppose that $x^0=(0,0,0)$. Then $m^0 \in \llbracket 0, 3 \rrbracket$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item If $m^0=0$, then no bit will change between the first and the second output of our CI PRNG Version 2. Thus $x^1 = (0,0,0)$.
\item If $m^0=1$, then exactly one bit will change, which leads to three possible values for $x^1$, namely $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$.
\item \emph{etc.}
\end{itemize}
Each value in $\llbracket 0, 2^3-1 \rrbracket$ must be returned with the same frequency, then the values $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$ must occur for $x^1$ with the same probability. Finally we see that, in this example, $m^0=1$ must be three times more probable than $m^0=0$.
This leads to the following general definition for the probability of $m=i$:
\begin{equation}
P(m^n=i)=\frac{C^i_N}{2^N}
\end{equation}

Then, here is an example for the $(m^n)$ sequence definition using a selector function $g_1$, where $y^n$ is the product of PRNG1:
\begin{equation}
\label{v2_g1}
m^n = g_1(y^n)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
0 \text{ if }0 \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<\frac{C^0_N}{2^N},\\
1 \text{ if }\frac{C^0_N}{2^N} \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<\sum_{i=0}^1\frac{C^i_N}{2^N},\\
2 \text{ if }\sum_{i=0}^1\frac{C^i_N}{2^N} \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<\sum_{i=0}^2\frac{C^i_N}{2^N},\\
\vdots~~~~~ ~~\vdots~~~ ~~~~\\
N \text{ if }\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\frac{C^i_N}{2^N} \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<1.\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

The CI PRNG Version 2 can use any reasonable function as selector like ~\cite{bibtexwangqianxue}:
\begin{equation}
\label{v2_g2}
m^n = g_2(y^n)=
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
N \text{ if }0 \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<\frac{C^0_N}{2^N},\\
N-1 \text{ if }\frac{C^0_N}{2^N} \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<\sum_{i=0}^1\frac{C^i_N}{2^N},\\
N-2 \text{ if }\sum_{i=0}^1\frac{C^i_N}{2^N} \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<\sum_{i=0}^2\frac{C^i_N}{2^N},\\
\vdots~~~~~ ~~\vdots~~~ ~~~~\\
0 \text{ if }\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\frac{C^i_N}{2^N} \leqslant\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}<1.\\
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

In this thesis, $g_1()$ is the selector function unless noted otherwise. 


\subsection{strategy}
\label{Chaotic strategy}
The strategy $(S^k) \in \llbracket 1, N \rrbracket^\mathds{N}$ is generated using a second generator PRNG2's sequence $(b^k) \in \llbracket 1, N \rrbracket^\mathds{N}$ (see \cite{Bahi2000} for further details). The only difference between the sequences $S$ and $b$ is that some terms of $b$ are discarded, in such a way that $\forall k \in \mathds{N}, (S^{M^k}, S^{M^k+1}, \hdots, S^{M^{k+1}-1})$ does not contain any given integer twice, where $M^k = \sum_{i=0}^k m^i$. Therefore, no bit will change more than once between two successive outputs of this PRNG proposed in \cite{wbg10:ip}, increasing the speed of the former generator by doing so. $S$ is said to be ``an irregular decimation'' of $b$. This decimation can be obtained by the following process (see \cite{wbg10:ip}).

Let $(d^1,d^2,\dots,d^N)\in \{0,1\}^N$ be a mark sequence, such that whenever $\sum_{i=1}^N d^i = m^k$,
then $\forall i, d_i=0$ ($\forall k$, the sequence is reset when $d$ contains $m^k$ times the number 1). This mark sequence will control the PRNG2 sequence $b$ as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item if $d^{b^j} \neq 1$, then $S^k=b^j$, $d^{b^j} = 1$, and $k = k+1$,
\item if $d^{b^j}=1$, then $b^j$ is discarded.
\end{itemize}
For example, if $b = 142\underline{2}334 1421\underline{1}\underline{2}\underline{2}34...$ and $m = 4341...$, then $S=1423~341~4123~4...$ However, if we do not use the mark sequence, then one position may change more than once and the balance property will not be checked, due to the fact that $\bar{\bar{x}}=x$. As an example, for $b$ and $m$ as in the previous example, $S=1422~334~1421~1...$ and $S=14~4~42~1...$ lead to the same output (because switching the same bit twice leads to the same state).

 
To check the balance property, a set of $500$
sequences are generated with and without decimation, each
sequence containing $10^6$ bits. Fig.\ref{nmark} shows the
percentages of differences between zeros and ones, and presents a better balance property for the sequences with decimation. This claim has been verified in the tests~\cite{wbg10:ip}.

\subsection{CIPRNG version 2: the algorithm}

The basic design procedure of the novel generator is summed up in Algo.\ref{Chaotic iteration1}.
The internal state is $x$, it is an integer of $N$ bits size. The output state is $r$. $a$ and $b$ are those computed by the two input
PRNGs. The value $g_1(a)$ is an integer, defined as in Eq.(\ref{v2_g1}). Lastly, $\mathsf{N}$ is a constant 
defined by the user.

\section{XOR CIPRNG}
Instead of updating only one cell at each iteration as the previous versions of
our CIPRNGs, we can try to choose a subset of components and to update them together. Such an attempt leads
to a kind of merger of the two random sequences. When the updating function is the vectorial 
negation, this algorithm can be rewritten as follows~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1112-5239}:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
x^0 \in \llbracket 0, 2^\mathsf{N}-1 \rrbracket, S \in \llbracket 0, 2^\mathsf{N}-1 \rrbracket^\mathds{N} \\
d^n = S^n\\
\forall n \in \mathds{N}^*, x^n = x^{n-1} \oplus d^n,
\end{array}
\right.
\label{equation Oplus1}
\end{equation}

\noindent and this rewriting can be understood as follows. The $n^{th}$ term $S^n$ of the sequence $S$, 
which is an integer of $\mathsf{N}$ binary digits, presents
the list of cells to update in the state $x^n$ of the system (represented as an integer 
having $\mathsf{N}$ bits too). More precisely, the $k^{th}$
component of this state (a binary digit) changes if and only if the $k^{th}$ digit in the 
binary decomposition of $S^n$ is 1. This generator has been called XOR CIPRNG by
the AND team, which has introduced and studied it in\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1112-5239, bfg12a:ip}.

The single basic component presented in Eq.(\ref{equation Oplus1}) is of ordinary use as a 
good elementary brick in various PRNGs. It corresponds
to the discrete dynamical system in chaotic iterations.
Such XOR CIPRNG has inspired us to introduce a more general category of CIPRNGs, presented
in Chapter~\ref{CI dev}.
%As a comparison, the basic design procedure of the old generator 
%is recalled in Algorithm~\ref{Chaotic iteration2} ($a$ and $b$ are computed by two input PRNGs, 
%$\mathsf{N}$ and $c\geqslant 3\mathsf{N}$ are constants defined by the user). 
%See Subsection~\ref{Version 1 CI algorithms and examples} for further information.

%\subsection{Illustrative Example of Version 2 CI (XORshift, XORshift)}
%
%In this example, $\mathsf{N} = 4$ is chosen for easy understanding and the input PRNG is XORshift PRNG. As stated before, the initial state of the system $x^0$ can be seeded by the decimal part $t$ of the current time. For example, if the current time in seconds since the Epoch is 1237632934.484088,
%so $t = 484088$, then $x^0 = t \text{ ($mod$ 16)}$ in binary digits, \emph{i.e.}, $x^0 = ( 0, 1, 0, 0)$.
%
%To compute $m$ sequence, Eq.(\ref{v2_g1}) can be adapted to this example as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{m1 fuction}
%m^n=g_1(y^n)=
%\left\{
%\begin{array}{llccccc}
%0 & \text{ if }&0 &\leqslant&\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}&<&\frac{1}{16},\\
%1 & \text{ if }&\frac{1}{16} &\leqslant&\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}&<&\frac{5}{16} ,\\
%2 & \text{ if }&\frac{5}{16} &\leqslant&\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}&<&\frac{11}{16},\\
%3 & \text{ if }&\frac{11}{16} &\leqslant&\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}&<&\frac{15}{16},\\
%4 & \text{ if }&\frac{15}{16} &\leqslant&\frac{y^n}{2^{32}}&<&1,\\
%\end{array}
%\right.
%\end{equation}
%
%\noindent where $y$ is generated by XORshift seeded with the current time. 
%We can see that the probabilities of occurrences of $m=0$, $m=1$, $m=2$, $m=3$, $m=4$, 
%are $\frac{1}{16}$, $\frac{4}{16}$, $\frac{6}{16}$, $\frac{4}{16}$, $\frac{1}{16}$, respectively. 
%This $m$ determines what will be the next output $x$. For instance,
%\begin{itemize}
%\item If $m=0$, the following $x$ will be $( 0, 1, 0, 0)$.
%\item If $m=1$, the following $x$ can be $( 1, 1, 0, 0)$, $( 0, 0, 0, 0)$, $( 0, 1, 1, 0)$, or $( 0, 1, 0, 1)$.
%\item If $m=2$, the following $x$ can be $( 1, 0, 0, 0)$, $( 1, 1, 1, 0)$, $( 1, 1, 0, 1)$, $( 0, 0, 1, 0)$, $( 0, 0, 0, 1)$, or $( 0, 1, 1, 1)$.
%\item If $m=3$, the following $x$ can be $( 0, 0, 1, 1)$, $( 1, 1, 1, 1)$, $( 1, 0, 0, 1)$, or $( 1, 0, 1, 0)$.
%\item If $m=4$, the following $x$ will be $( 1, 0, 1, 1)$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%In this simulation, $m = 0, 4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4,...$ Additionally, 
%$b$ is computed with a XORshift generator too, but with another seed. We have found 
%$b = 1, 4, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1,...$
%
%Chaotic iterations are made with initial state $x^0$, vectorial logical negation $f_0$, and
%strategy $S$. The result is presented in Tab.\ref{table application example}. Let us 
%recall that sequence $m$ gives the states $x^n$ to return, which are here $x^0, x^{0+4}, 
%x^{0+4+2}, \hdots$ So, in this example, the output of the generator is: 10100111101111110011... or 4,4,11,8,1...
